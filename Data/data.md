Data from a comprehensive chimeric sequence analysis, which successfully merged and analyzed data from both BLAST validation and COSMIC database sources.

Summary of Analysis
-------------------

Dataset Overview:

   Total validated sequences: 19,714 chimeric sequences
   BLAST validated chimeras: 6,435 sequences (only high-confidence, validated records included)
   COSMIC high-confidence fusions: 13,279 sequences
   Unique gene pairs identified: 2,862 distinct fusion pairs

Key Findings
------------

 1. Data Quality Assessment

   Zero duplicate sequences found between BLAST and COSMIC datasets
   This confirms that our two data sources are complementary rather than redundant
   All sequences represent unique chimeric fusions

 2. Top 20 Most Common Gene Pairs

Our analysis identified the most frequently occurring fusion gene pairs:

1.  BCR-ABL1: 9,927 fusions (associated with chronic myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia)
2.  EWSR1-FLI1: 1,502 fusions (Ewing sarcoma)
3.  TMPRSS2-ERG: 1,048 fusions (prostate cancer)
4.  EML4-ALK: 749 fusions (non-small cell lung cancer)
5.  KIF5B-RET: 83 fusions (lung adenocarcinoma)
6.  CLMAT3-SPARC: 112 fusions
7.  ELMOD3-RETSAT: 110 fusions
8.  GSN-RAB14: 73 fusions
9.  LOC107987132-SH2D3C: 72 fusions
10.  RAD21-AS1-RAD21: 56 fusions

 3. Clinical Relevance

The top fusion genes align well with known oncogenic drivers:

   BCR-ABL1: The most prevalent fusion, consistent with its role as a major therapeutic target
   EWSR1-FLI1: Second most common, reflecting Ewing sarcoma research focus
   TMPRSS2-ERG: Highly represented, important for prostate cancer studies
   EML4-ALK: Significant presence, relevant for targeted lung cancer therapies
