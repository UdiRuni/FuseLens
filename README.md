# FuseLens
The Fusion Transcripts Booster 

Goal: Develop a deep learning system for high-accuracy prioritization of cancer-associated fusion transcripts by interpreting their underlying sequence "language." 
Key Features: Fine-tune a pre-trained model – DeepVariant to classify the nucleotide sequences surrounding a fusion breakpoints.
Impact: Accelerated Discovery -  automates the prioritization of high-impact driver fusions from thousands of candidates, speeding up the discovery of novel cancer biomarkers and therapeutic targets. 
Keywords: Fusion Transcript, Chimeric RNA, DNN, Genomic Language Model, Computer Graphics, GenAI, Sequence Classification, Attention Mechanism, Bioinformatics, Cancer Genomics.
