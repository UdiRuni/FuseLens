Bioinformatics software and data management are facilitated mostly using the Linux
OS. You would need to make sure you have access to a UNIX based operating system, i.e., Linux, MacOS, FreeBSD, with a
strong preference to a Linux based distribution. 

Windows OS users are can enable WSL functionality and review the following guides

We recommend installing Anaconda as your environment package manager as most
tools (probably all that we will be using in the scope of this project) are available via the
Bioconda channel. Working with Conda for bioinformatics will allow you to easily install
packages and resolve dependency conflicts. Please review the [BIOCONDA](https://bioconda.github.io/) channel for
more information, and how to install it for your system.
